    <div id="meText"><p>My name is Zachary Kilboy. I am 28 years old. I have recently moved to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
I enjoy tinkering with electronics, mechanics, and all manner of systems. I keep a blog about my projects on a personal
<a href="http://www.zkilboy.com">website</a>. The images used here are taken directly from my <a href="http://www.zkilboy.com">website</a>, if you are intrigued
please check it out!</p><p>In 2015 I completed my BSc in Physics. I enjoy learning new things and 
making connections between things I have learned. If I have learned anything in my pursuits it is that no event occurs in a 
vacuum. Studying anything in isolation will only ever tell you part of the story, and there is always more story to tell.</p>
